# Freeman's FinChart SketchPlugin
Financial chart tool for Sketch

A good UX designer should always design pages with real data, this idea gives real pain when your work involve a lot of charts. A designer need to lay eyes on actual charts to adjust size, gap, color or such, but drawing a candlestick or a realistic-looking line chart manually is real waste of time, so here comes the rescue.

## Feature:
- Draw Candlestick chart base on real data
- Draw Line chart base on real data
- Fully editable output with separated layers

## TODO:

- More design things to tweak (Padding, Gap between two charts, Area fill for line charts…)
- More shape of data (Rise, Fall, Turbulence…)
- Allow user input data (CSV, Copy-Paste data text…)
