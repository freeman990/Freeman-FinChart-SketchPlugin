# Freeman's FinChart SketchPlugin
Financal Chart tool for Sketch

A good UX designer should always design pages with real data, this was really painful when your work involve a lot of charts, you need to see the actual charts in your design to adjust color, gap or such, but drawing a candlestick or a real-looking line chart manually is real waste of time, so here comes the rescue.

## Feature:
- Fully editable financial chart.
- Customizable Candlestick showing candle number and gaps

## TODO:
- Grid line & footnote for charts
- Volume Chart for candlestick & line
- More design things to tweak (Padding, Gap between two charts, Area fill for line charts…)
- More shape of data (Rise, Fall, Turbulence…)
- Allow user input data (CSV, Copy-Paste data text…)
