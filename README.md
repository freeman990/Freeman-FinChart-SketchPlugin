# Freeman's FinChart SketchPlugin

Draw financial chart with built-in real data.

A good UX designer should always design pages with real data, they need to be able to see the actual result to make the proper design decision. But when it comes to chart related design, it's really painful to follow the conduct, drawing a Candlestick Chart or a realistic-looking Line Chart manually is a real waste of time, so here comes the rescue.

#### Tested Sketch Version: 55.2
